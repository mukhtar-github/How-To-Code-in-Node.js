# How To Write and Run Your First Program in Node.js

## Introduction

*Node.js* is a popular open-source runtime environment that can execute *JavaScript* outside of the browser using the V8 *JavaScript* engine, which is the same engine used to power the Google Chrome web browser’s *JavaScript* execution. The Node runtime is commonly used to create command line tools and web servers.

Learning *Node.js* will allow you to write your *front-end* code and your *back-end code* in the same language. Using *JavaScript* throughout your entire stack can help reduce time for context switching, and libraries are more easily shared between your back-end server and *front-end* projects.

Also, thanks to its support for asynchronous execution, *Node.js* excels at I/O-intensive tasks, which is what makes it so suitable for the web. Real-time applications, like video streaming, or applications that continuously send and receive data, can run more efficiently when written in *Node.js*.

In this tutorial you’ll create your first program with the *Node.js* runtime. You’ll be introduced to a few Node-specific concepts and build your way up to create a program that helps users inspect environment variables on their system. To do this, you’ll learn how to output strings to the console, receive input from the user, and access environment variables.

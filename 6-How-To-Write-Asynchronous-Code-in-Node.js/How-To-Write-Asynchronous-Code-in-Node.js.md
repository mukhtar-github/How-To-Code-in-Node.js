# How To Write Asynchronous Code in Node.js

## Introduction

For many programs in *JavaScript*, code is executed as the developer writes it—line by line. This is called *synchronous execution*, because the lines are executed one after the other, in the order they were written. However, not every instruction you give to the computer needs to be attended to immediately. For example, if you send a *network request*, the process executing your code will have to wait for the *data* to return before it can work on it. In this case, time would be wasted if it did not execute other code while waiting for the *network request* to be completed. To solve this problem, developers use *asynchronous programming*, in which lines of code are executed in a different order than the one in which they were written. With *asynchronous programming*, we can execute other code while we wait for long activities like *network request*s to finish.

*JavaScript* code is executed on a *single thread* within a computer process. Its code is processed *synchronously* on this thread, with only *one instruction run at a time*. Therefore, if we were to do a *long-running task* on this thread, all of the remaining code is blocked until the task is complete. By leveraging *JavaScript’s asynchronous programming* features, we can *offload long-running tasks to a background thread* to avoid this problem. When the task is complete, the code we need to process the task’s data is put back on the main *single thread*.
